# Passwordless Authenticator

1. Download Visual Studio 2022 on your Windows machine. 
2. Clone the repo and import the Project onto Visual Studio.
3. MainPage.xaml is the Login Page for the Authenticator App.
4. BlankPage1(wasn't able to rename as the build was throwing some error, weird!) is the Landing page from the login page.
5. Click on the green play symbol inside Visual Studio to build and run the project.

DB Connection:
1. DataAccess.cs is the boiler plate for SQLite. Add all your DB methods there. 
2. The DataAccess.InitializeDatabase() function is called inside the App.xaml file(executes everytime you run the project).

Happy Coding!
